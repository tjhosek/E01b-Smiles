A series of python programs that draw smiley faces on a screen. Each successive program adds more variables that help to make the code easier to change, for example if I wanted to change the position of the simley face in the 1st program, I would have to change the individual values of each element of the smiley, wheras in the 3rd program I only need to change the face_x and face_y variables.

Main4 is different in that it is drawing an entire grid of overlapping smileys. I have made the grid more dense and larger, to the point where you can't even see the details on the face. By changing the values in the for loops, I can affect how often smiley faces are drawn and out to what part of the screen.

Main5 is special in that the smiley drawn there will follow your mouse movements. I have commented each line with what I believe they do, although some of it is based off of speculation and work with other langauges, as I am still relatively unfamilliar with python.
